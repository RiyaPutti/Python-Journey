ğŸ“ŒConcepts Covered:

input() â†’ takes user input as a string

int() â†’ typecasting to integer

Variables â†’ used to store data

Arithmetic operator (-) â†’ subtraction

ğŸ§  Logic:

The user's birth year is taken via input() and converted to an integer.

The current year is hardcoded (could be made dynamic with datetime).

Age is calculated by subtracting birth_year from current_year.

print() displays the final result using string concatenation and/or formatting.'''
