ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered:
- Function with return value
- Set for membership testing
- Loop iteration
- String manipulation 
- User input handling
ðŸ§  Logic:
We define a set of vowels and iterate through each character in the string. If the character is found in the set, we increment the count. Finally, we return the total count of vowels.
