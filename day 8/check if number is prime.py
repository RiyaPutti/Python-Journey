ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered:

Function with return value

Range and loop iteration

Optimization using square root

Modulo operator for divisibility check

ðŸ§  Logic:
A prime number is divisible only by 1 and itself. Instead of checking up to n-1, we optimize by checking till âˆšn as a factor beyond that would have a corresponding smaller factor already checked.'''
