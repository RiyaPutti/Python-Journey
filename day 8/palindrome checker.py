    Check if a string is a palindrome.
    A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered:
- String manipulation
- Function with return value
- String slicing
- User input handling
- Conditional logic
ðŸ§  Logic:
We first normalize the string by converting it to lowercase and removing spaces. Then we check if the string is equal to its reverse using slicing. If they are equal, the string is a palindrome.
